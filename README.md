- Find out the optimal ratio for each type of gasoline to minimize the cost

Several forms of gasoline are produced during the petroleum refining process, 
and a last step combines them to obtain market products with specified quality 
measures. Suppose 4 different gasolines are available, with values for the 2 
indexes of quality being 99 and 210, 70 and 335, 78 and 280, and 91 and 265, 
respectively. Using corresponding costs per barrel of $48, $43, $58, and $46,
we would like to choose a minimum cost blend with a first quality index
between 85 and 90 and a second index between 270 and 280.
